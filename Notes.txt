# Object oriented programming
"""

Class = new type
Object = instances of a Class
Fields = variables that belong to an object or Class
Methods = functions that belong to a Class
* Functions and variables are independent, while fields and methods belong to a Class
Attributes = fields and methods of a Class

- Field types
instance variables = fields that belong to an instance / object
class variables = fields that belong to a class itself

-the self
A variable that refers to the Class itself
Exampme:
class named MyClass
instance named myobject

myobject.method(arg1, arg2) = MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2)
